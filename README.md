# Weather Checker https://mage1404.github.io/Weather-checker/

## AS A traveler, I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities, SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

## WHEN I search for a city

## THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

## WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city

## THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

## WHEN I view the UV index

## THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

## WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city

## THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

## WHEN I click on a city in the search history

## THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
